# PyBer_Analysis


## Overview of the Analysis
#### The purpose of this analysis is to take the data we were given from the Pyber rideshare company and find the total fare based on the city type, Urban, Suburban, or Rural. We were asked to create a visual to present to Pyber to easily show how the fares differed in each city type, and about how much each fare cost depedning on the month. This way, Pyber can adjust their prices or adjust how many drivers are in each city type.

## Results

#### Based on the analysis, there are more rides taken in urban cities where people in rural cities use Pyber the least. In additon, urban cities have the most drivers and there are the least amount of drivers in rural areas. Due to the fewer amount of rides taken and fewer drivers, the fares in rural cites cost more than those in suburban and urban areas. Although, urban cities make the most money on their total fares even with having the cheapest fare prices.

## Summary
#### Based on the analysis, Pyber needs to get more drivers out in rural cities to help with the demand of rides in those areas. With more drivers in these areas, the prices will go down and more people may be able to take more rides because they could be in their price range. This woukd then lead to higher revenue like how we have seen in urban areas.
